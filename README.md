# METAR Reader

A Flask web application that decodes METAR (Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report) into plain English.

## What is METAR?

METAR is a standardized format for reporting weather information at airports. These reports are used by pilots, air traffic controllers, and meteorologists but can be difficult for the general public to understand. This application translates these cryptic codes into simple, readable weather reports.

## Features

- Enter any 4-letter ICAO airport code
- Fetches real-time METAR data from aviationweather.gov
- Decodes METAR into plain English:
  - Wind direction and speed (converted to compass directions)
  - Visibility conditions
  - Weather phenomena (rain, fog, snow, etc.)
  - Sky conditions and cloud cover
  - Temperature and dewpoint
  - Atmospheric pressure (altimeter)
- Responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Example airport codes for quick testing
- Real-time weather data

## Usage

1. Enter a 4-letter ICAO airport code (e.g., KHIO for Hillsboro Airport)
2. View the decoded weather report in plain English

## Example Airport Codes

- KHIO - Hillsboro Airport, Oregon
- KJFK - John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York
- KLAX - Los Angeles International Airport
- KORD - Chicago O'Hare International Airport
- KSFO - San Francisco International Airport
- KDEN - Denver International Airport
- KSEA - Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
- KMIA - Miami International Airport

## Docker Commands

The application includes a Makefile with convenient commands:

```
make build      # Build the Docker image (production)
make build-dev  # Build the Docker image (development)
make run        # Run the application in a container (production)
make run-dev    # Run the application in a container (development)
make dev        # Run the application in development mode with live reload
make stop       # Stop the running container
make test       # Run unit tests
make test-dev   # Run unit tests in development container
make clean      # Remove the Docker images
make logs       # View container logs
make shell      # Access the container shell
make shell-dev  # Access the development container shell
make deploy     # Build and deploy the application
make size       # Show Docker image sizes
make help       # Show all available commands
```

### Development vs Production Images

The project uses separate Docker images for development and production:

- **Development image** (`Dockerfile.dev`): Includes test files and development dependencies
- **Production image** (`Dockerfile`): Excludes test files and only includes runtime dependencies

This separation ensures that:
1. Production images are smaller and more secure
2. Development images include everything needed for testing and debugging
3. Tests can be run in Docker containers using the development image

## Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose for development:

```
docker-compose up -d    # Start the application
docker-compose down     # Stop the application
```

## Image Optimization

This application uses a multi-stage Docker build to minimize image size:

1. **Builder Stage**: Installs build dependencies and Python packages
2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses a minimal Alpine Linux base with only runtime dependencies
3. **Non-root User**: Runs the application as a non-root user for security
4. **Separate Requirements**: Production and development dependencies are separated

The production image is significantly smaller than a single-stage build, reducing:
- Attack surface
- Network transfer time
- Storage requirements
- Startup time

To check image sizes:
```
make size
```

## How It Works

1. The application sends a request to `https://aviationweather.gov/api/data/metar?ids={STATION_ID}`
2. The METAR data is parsed and decoded using regular expressions and custom logic
3. The cryptic codes are translated into plain English descriptions:
   - Wind direction (e.g., "18005KT" becomes "South at 5 knots")
   - Visibility (e.g., "10SM" becomes "10 statute miles")
   - Weather conditions (e.g., "-RA" becomes "Light Rain")
   - Sky conditions (e.g., "SCT009 BKN013" becomes "Scattered clouds at 900 feet, Broken clouds at 1300 feet")
   - Temperature/Dewpoint (e.g., "16/15" becomes "Temperature 16째C, Dewpoint 15째C")
   - Altimeter (e.g., "A2987" becomes "Altimeter 29.87 inches of mercury")
4. The results are displayed in a user-friendly web interface

## METAR Decoding Examples

### Sample METAR Report:
```
METAR KHIO 141253Z AUTO 18005KT 10SM -RA SCT009 BKN013 OVC090 16/15 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP111 P0001 T01610150
```

### Decoded Report:
```
Weather report for KHIO
Day 14 at 12:53 UTC
Wind: South at 5 knots
Visibility: 10 statute miles
Weather: Light Rain
Sky: Scattered clouds at 900 feet, Broken clouds at 1300 feet, Overcast at 9000 feet
Temperature 16째C, Dewpoint 15째C
Altimeter 29.87 inches of mercury
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask (web framework)
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (frontend)
- Requests library (for API calls)
- Regular expressions (for parsing)
- Docker (containerization)
- Makefile (build automation)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serve the main web interface
- `POST /metar` - API endpoint to fetch and decode METAR data

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the METAR decoding functionality works correctly. The tests use pytest and include:

- Tests for all compass wind directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest)
- Tests for various visibility formats (statute miles, fractional miles, meters, CAVOK)
- Tests for different weather conditions (rain, thunderstorms, snow, fog, mist, etc.)
- Tests for sky conditions (few, scattered, broken, overcast clouds at various altitudes)
- Tests for temperature and dewpoint decoding, including negative values
- Tests for altimeter pressure decoding in both inches of mercury and hectopascals
- Tests for edge cases and error conditions
- Mocked tests for the HTTP API calls to avoid external dependencies during testing

Run unit tests with:
```
make test-dev
```

Or directly with pytest:
```
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite thoroughly validates the `decode_metar()` function with realistic METAR data, ensuring that:

1. Wind information is correctly parsed and converted to compass directions
2. Visibility conditions are properly interpreted
3. Weather phenomena are accurately decoded
4. Sky conditions and cloud cover are correctly reported
5. Temperature and dewpoint values are properly extracted
6. Atmospheric pressure readings are correctly formatted
7. Error conditions are handled gracefully

### Running Tests in a Virtual Environment

To run tests locally with a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run the tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to be run automatically in CI/CD pipelines and can be integrated with tools like GitHub Actions for automated testing on every commit.
